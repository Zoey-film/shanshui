# Design Document for Shanshui Poetry App

## Overview

The Shanshui Poetry App is a web application designed to showcase and allow user interaction with Chinese poetry inspired by the seasons. Built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, the app provides a seamless experience for users to read and submit poems, with a focus on aesthetic presentation and user engagement.

## Architecture

The application follows a typical Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- **Model**: The data layer is managed using SQLite, a lightweight database that stores user-submitted poems. The database is initialized with a `poems` table to store poem content, author, associated season, and timestamp.

- **View**: The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Templates are rendered using Jinja2, Flask's templating engine, allowing dynamic content to be served based on user interaction and database queries.

- **Controller**: Flask routes handle user requests, manage database interactions, and render appropriate templates. The application logic is encapsulated within these routes, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

## Key Features and Design Decisions

### 1. Dynamic Content Rendering

The app uses Flask's `render_template` function to dynamically render HTML pages based on user input and database content. This allows for a personalized user experience, where poems and images change based on the selected season.

### 2. Database Management

SQLite was chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration with Flask. The database is initialized at the start of the application using the `init_db()` function, ensuring that the necessary tables are created if they do not exist. This approach simplifies deployment and reduces dependencies.

### 3. User Interaction

The app includes a form for users to submit their poems. This form is processed by a Flask route that inserts the submitted data into the database. The decision to use server-side form handling ensures data integrity and security.

### 4. Front-End Design

The front-end design emphasizes simplicity and readability. CSS is used to style the pages, with a focus on typography and layout to enhance the reading experience. The use of Google Fonts, such as 'Jost', ensures a consistent and modern aesthetic.

### 5. Audio Integration

The app includes background music to enhance the user experience. JavaScript is used to manage audio playback, with a toggle button allowing users to control the music. This feature is implemented with user experience in mind, ensuring that audio does not autoplay without user interaction, in compliance with modern browser policies.

### 6. Responsive Design

The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes. CSS media queries and flexible layouts are used to adapt the content presentation, maintaining a consistent user experience.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

One of the challenges faced was ensuring cross-browser compatibility, particularly with audio playback. Future improvements could include expanding the database to support user accounts and poem ratings, enhancing the interactive elements of the app. Additionally, implementing a more robust error handling mechanism would improve the app's resilience and user feedback.

## Conclusion

The Shanshui Poetry App is a blend of technical implementation and artistic presentation, designed to engage users with the beauty of Chinesepoetry. The design decisions made throughout the project reflect a balance between functionality, user experience, and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
